Task 1: The Foundation,
Configurable  Growing Grid,5
MouseClicked show row and column index in console windows,5
MouseMoved shows focus,5
,
Task 2: The Status,
The top of the status must show your name and last name.,1
Variable declared with correct type for *money*,1
Show focused cell informations (row and col) when mouse hover over a cell,3
Calculate and show Game day,5
,
Task 3: The State Memory,
Declared 2D array with correct type and size to store mushrooms’ growing state,1
"Initially all the elements of the array is -1 which means all the cells are cleared (implies, the cells are not used).",1
The content of a cell in the grid is drawn according to the state of each cell. (need to inspect code),3
,
Task 4: The Seeding,
"Using the keyboard interaction, if the player presses the 's' key and the focused cell is in the cleared state, then the cell should be in the sporing state. 10 coins is deducted from the total *money*.",3
"If the play presses the 'c' key, the cell changes to the clear state. 2 coins is deducted from the total coin.",3
The grid should be updated both visually and logically according to the state array.,3
"Make sure that if there is not enough coins, the game must not allow the player to seed and clean the cell.",3
,
Task 5: The Basic Grower,
"If the state of a cell is *cleared* or *empty*, the cell remains in the same state. Other wise change the cell to the next state. For example if a cell is in *sporing* state, it changes to *rooting* state.",5
Mushrooms in the grid evolve at the end of each game day.,5
The display of the content of the grid updates accordingly.,5
,
Task 6: The Harvesting,
"Using the keyboard interaction, if the player presses the 'h' key on a focused cell and the cell state is in the *Ready* state, the mushroom in the cell is harvested.",3
"Once a cell is harvested, the cell state changes to the *empty* state. 20 coins are added to the total coin.",3
,
Task 7: The Intermediate Grower,
Declared 2D array with correct type and size to store mushrooms’ seeding time.,3
"When a mushroom is seeded in a cell, the element of the array at the same row and column index should be set to the value of Processing's internal variable *frameCount*.",3
The mushroom now changes its state only when *0 == frameCount - seedingTime % oneDay* is true where *seedingTime* is the element of the array at the corresponding row and column index.,5
"When a cell (at row and column) is cleared, the content of the row and column index in this array is set to -1.",3
,
Task 8: The Watering,
Declared 2D array with correct type and size to store moisture level of each growing mushrooms. Initialize the contents of the array with 0.0,2
"When a mushroom is seeded in a cell, the element of the array at the same row and column index should be set to 50 (50% moisture)",2
"In each *game day*, each cell loses its moisture by 30%. However its lower bound is zero and upper bound to 100%. In other words the *moisture* level cannot be a negative number or more than 100.",5
"The player adds moisture to a cell by focusing the mouse over the cell and presses the 'w' key. This increases moisture level by 30%. Cells that are currently in state *Cleared* must not be allowed to add moisture. Make sure that if there is not enough coins, the game must not allow the player to water the cell.",5
"Each time when the player adds moisture, it costs 2 coins and should be deducted from *money*",2
The status should display the amount moisture of each cell accordingly when a cell is focused.,2
,
Task 9: The Advance Grower,
"if the moisture of the cell is below 20% or above 90%, the cell changes to *dead* state. ",5
,
Total,100
